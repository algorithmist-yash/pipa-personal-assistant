# PIPA — Personal Intelligent Progress Analyzer

PIPA is a **Personal Intelligent Progress Analyzer** designed to act as an AI‑powered mentor, accountability partner, and productivity analyst. It is especially tailored for long‑term, high‑stakes goals such as **UPSC preparation**, **advanced mathematics**, and **AI research & startup building**.

---

## 🎯 Vision

Build a single, extensible AI assistant that:

* Continuously analyzes daily work and progress
* Aligns actions with long‑term goals
* Provides structured feedback, summaries, and corrections
* Acts as a mentor + analyst rather than a generic chatbot

---

## 🧠 Core Capabilities

* 📊 **Daily Progress Analysis** – evaluates tasks completed vs planned
* 🧩 **Goal‑Aligned Planning** – maps daily actions to long‑term timelines
* 🧪 **AI Research Roadmapping** – NLP → ML → DL → Agentic AI
* 📚 **UPSC‑Focused Intelligence** – GS + Optional (Maths) tracking
* 🧠 **Cognitive & Productivity Feedback** – detects overload, imbalance, gaps
* 📝 **Brief Generation** – automatic daily / weekly summaries
